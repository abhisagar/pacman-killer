Description:
	This game consists of a ball that is manually controlled. There are a huge number of balls moving in the screen automatically.
	These are the enemies. There are some enemies with planks over them.
	The motive of the game is to score points by jumping over these enemies. Jumping over the simple enemies will give you a vertical velocity.
	But by striking the enemies with planks, the velocity provided depends on the laws of reflection;
	The score received by finishing enemy depends over the color of the enemy.
	The game consists of 3 levels. The level increments if the score is made in the given time limit.
	The player is able to autopann the game i.e the screen will move with the ball.
	The player can also pause the game in between if he wants to.
	The game also has a trampoline, jumping over which will boost players vertical speed.
	There is also a pond which works using the laws of motion.
	Porcupines are also present which when touched dissapear giving a negative score in return.
	In level 2 and 3 the player will also face a magnet which will pull the player towards itself.
	The game will finish either when the timer runs off or the player completes the 3rd level.
	The player can also zoom in/out using the scroll if he wants to.
	If the auto panning is off the player can use the arrow keys to set the desired orientation of the game by moving the screen.
